ReMarkable.NET (rM.NET) is a collection of software drivers for the various hardware used throughout the reMarkable tablet ecosystem which allow the hardware to be used in a managed context through .NET Core.

## Issues

If you find an issue, or have a suggestion for a new feature, please don't hesitate to open an issue for discussion.

## Contributing

Please feel free to add bugfixes and support for new hardware. My vision for this project is that rM.NET contains as little state as possible and leaves the implementation details of the interfaced hardware up to the end user
